"Spoilboard - Fixture Friendly v50.f3d"
Fusion 360 model of the "new" spoilboard with foundation board and associated fixtures. You can easily toggle the visibility of the aluminum table, bonded-on phenolic boards, foundation board, fixture sections, and the planned fixtures. Those fixture boards are in the future, but I hope to make them when I return to Madison in March 2024. Note the sketch called "Machine home". This shows the location of the machine's home location (X and Y only) in relation to the model. Given offsets between the machine home and locations in the model, you could use the machine's location table (under the Setup menu) to make the machine consider such a location as it's X,Y [0,0] point. If you place your model on a fixture, you could locate your part in X and Y without any "eyeballing" or manual intervention based on the machine's homing function. The machine's home location in Z is at the top of the router's travel, and not real useful. However, by combining the automated X,Y location with the touchplate, you can locate your part with completely automated proceses. This can be convenient, but also gives you a repeatable location within about 0.010".
