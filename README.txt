This project contains files for "community use" by myself and fellow users of the CNC Router at the Bodgery in Madison Wisconsin.  While this respository is public and others may share in it, it hasn't been designed for use outside this community.

"Spoilboard - Fixture Friendly v50.f3d"
Fusion 360 model of the "new" spoilboard with foundation board and associated fixtures. You can easily toggle the visibility of the aluminum table, bonded-on phenolic boards, foundation board, fixture sections, and the planned fixtures. Those fixture boards are in the future, but I hope to make them when I return to Madison in March 2024. Note the sketch called "Machine home". This shows the location of the machine's home location (X and Y only) in relation to the model. Given offsets between the machine home and locations in the model, you could use the machine's location table (under the Setup menu) to make the machine consider such a location as it's X,Y [0,0] point. If you place your model on a fixture, you could locate your part in X and Y without any "eyeballing" or manual intervention based on the machine's homing function. The machine's home location in Z is at the top of the router's travel, and not real useful. However, by combining the automated X,Y location with the touchplate, you can locate your part with completely automated proceses. This can be convenient, but also gives you a repeatable location within about 0.010".

It is possible to design many different kinds of fixtures to work with the fixture hold-downs provided in the foundation board. The ones shown provide a combination of dovetails using the Matchfit system as used by MicroJig hardware and 20mm dog holes as used by Festool hardware. The dovetail hardware can be used directly with dovetail nuts and machine screws or with clamps. Various kinds of wedges and cams can be used with the dog holes. In addition, the dogs can be placed in the dog holes for precise positioning of stock or in-progress workpieces. The fixture holding system is modular based on a grid consisting of 8 24" x 24" locations. A fixture using a single 24" x 24" location is a single "unit" or "1U" for short. The model shows 2 1U fixtures and 3 2U fixtures, covering the entire 48" x 96" table. It is our intention to provide a single 1U fixture along with a selection of dogs and clamps for community use. We plan to provide models and Gcode for members wanting to make their own fixtures using this design.
